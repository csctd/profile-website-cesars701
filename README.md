## Design
I will be using visual heirarchy a lot in my website design. Using images for album covers, video game art, etc. to draw the user's attention to that. I also will use cute pastel colors that will appeal to the audience that I want to bring this to. Moving images will be very important to my website design, so I will use them where I see fit and to where I want it to fit the aesthetic. 

## Accessability
I want to make sure that the fonts and font colors are readable enough for users who may have visual impairments such as color blindess, or blindness in general. Using bigger fonts, but also allowing for the user to adjust the fonts and colors themselves if possible. If I link any video clips, I want to make sure they have closed captioning for the users who are hard of hearing. I will test using my keyboard only to see if users are able to access content that has to be clicked, etc. I could also test how my website looks like with each different type of color blindness to make sure it looks well for the user.
